        <h1>Control</h1>
        <p>Electronic Power Steering with driver-selectable steering tuning allows you to have the most control, whenever you need it.<br><br> Meaty tires and upgraded suspension help with handling and body roll.<br><br>Power delivery from the hulking 485-hp V8 is very smooth. Predictable clutch engagement and an easy-effort pedal mean smooth starts and gear changes with the six-speed manual. Responsive steering helps with highway maneuverability. But in the city, there is no avoiding this car's immense proportions.</p>

        <h1>Comfort</h1>
        <p>The Dodge Challenger Hellcat has a wide body for Convenient space. <br><br> Even when fitted with the Widebody package and stiffer adaptive suspension, the Challenger's highway ride quality is very good. Seat comfort is still near the top of the class. A relatively quiet cabin helps make it a nice place to be for extended periods.<br><br>The Challenger delivers a comfortable ride over small road imperfections but can feel pretty unsettled over larger cracks and potholes. The adaptive suspension helps increase handling limits but is still pretty stiff in its softest setting for everyday driving. The large 20-inch wheels and stiff tire sidewalls don't do it any favors either.<br><br>The seat cushions are relatively flat and firm but comfortable enough for long road trips or commutes. Bolstering keeps you in place well enough around corners. The door and center armrests are nicely padded. The rear seats are genuinely adult-size and relatively comfortable, which is rare for the class.</p>
